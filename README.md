#Embedded JS code
Create a ensoring bookmarklet with the following features:
* It will detect all the images in a webpage and will place a "censoring square" (a red square will suffice) over them regardless of the image styling.
* It will display an always-visible button to remove all the squares.
* When used on this page, three squares will show up.
